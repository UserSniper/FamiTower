# PizzaTowerFamicom
Pizza Tower Famicom is a demake of Pizza Tower on the Famicom in C. The goal is to have the following:
- Title Screen
- Floor 1
- Full control scheme for Peppino

If you'd like to help contribute to the project (and fix the external identifier errors), shoot me a ping on my Discord server, and i'd be glad to add you in!
